## Notes
- Haven't decided the magazine size for the plasma weapons yet, currently the cutter / scattergun / beam rifle share a mag size of 50 each with the piercer having a 20 "round" magazine.
- Plasma ammo has no recipe yet, also some of the damage / armor pen numbers may change as i work on the patch.
