      <!-- Interface-->
		<li>Use loadouts to determine what your colonists should carry in their inventory. Use the equipment tab to access items.</li>
		
      <!-- Combat -->
		<li>Combat Extended's changes to weapon range and lethality make many tactics from vanilla Rimworld ill-advised.</li>
		<li>If your colonist can't hit the broad side of a barn, perhaps they are vision-impaired, less conscious or they weren't told to aim their shots.</li>
		<li>Simple, strong projectiles such as plasteel arrows survive the force of impact and can be re-used by you or your enemies.</li>
		<li>Ammunition stockpiles near your artillery allow for more rapid reloading. Just watch out for cook-off!</li>
		<li>Never underestimate the effects of flanking and enfilades.</li>
		
	<!--<li>If either shooter or target is unroofed in bad weather, accuracy diminishes.</li>-->
	<!--<li>Any dense smoke in the way of a shooter and their target has detrimental effects on accuracy.</li>-->
	<!--<li>Targets in dense smoke may experience negative health effects without a gas mask. At least they become more difficult to hit.</li>-->
		
	  <!-- Bleeding -->
		<li>Keep combat medics at the ready or use less-lethal beanbag ammunition if you plan to keep survivors after a firefight.</li>
		<li>Bleed-out is common and lethal. Any colonist with medicine in their inventory can stabilize a bleeding creature.</li>
		<li>Carrying medicine in their inventory will allow colonists to "stabilize" downed comrades (and enemies). Select the colonist, right-click your target and select "Stabilize".</li>
		<li>Stabilizing someone temporarily staunches their bleeding, but it does not treat the wound. How long depends on your doctor skill.</li>
		<li>The longer a wound remains untreated, the higher the risk of infection. Lying in the dirt doesn't help things either.</li>
		
	  <!-- Aiming -->
		<li>Targets are more difficult to spot in darkness, but shooters aren't penalized for being in darkness. Light 'em up!</li>
		<li>The most destructive equipment in a mortar squad is a good pair of binoculars on an experienced spotter.</li>
		<li>Good sights can negate inaccuracy due to bad weather, targets in darkness or targets in dense smoke.</li>
		<li>Shooters imperfectly lead their targets until they commit to a shot. Slower projectiles can be dodged.</li>
		<li>Gunmen are defenseless while they reload their gun. However, shotguns are often reloaded one-by-one, allowing them to be fired mid-reload.</li>
		<li>Moving targets are much larger than still, crouching ones. A crouched gunner reveals just enough to fire a shot.</li>
		<li>When a bullet fails to penetrate armor it won't cause bleeding or internal injuries, but may still inflict bruising.</li>
		<li>Sustained gun fire penalizes accuracy, so it is especially useful on clumped up, nearby targets.</li>
		<li>A well placed machinegun can temporarily halt an enemy advancement. Use machine guns to suppress enemies across a large area.</li>
		
	  <!-- Suppression -->
		<li>Prolonged suppression can cause special mental breaks to occur.</li>
		<li>Suppressed targets emit a yellow downwards arrow. Suppression incurs mood debuffs, prevents aiming shots and lowers accuracy.</li>
		<li>Hunkering targets emit an orange downwards arrow and dive for the nearest cover, where they build courage to return to the fight.</li>
		<li>Humans under suppression will panic and act on their own: they'll run for the nearest cover and be unable to use Aimed Shot.</li>
		<li>Intelligent beings finding themselves under enemy fire will become suppressed, diminishing their effectiveness in combat. Under especially heavy fire, they will stop what they are doing to seek cover and hunker down to avoid being killed.</li>
		<li>Thick armour instills courage against small arms fire, but its bulkiness reduces work speed.</li>
		
	  <!-- Items -->
		<li>Guns vary in calibre, accepted ammo types, long-range accuracy, magazine size.. Find out more by reading their information tab!</li>
		<li>Weapons excel in their respective roles: shotguns and SMG's are lethal at close range, sniper rifles attack from afar, machine guns can sustain suppression, rifles strike a balance.</li>
		<li>Shotguns can use a variety of special ammunition types such as EMP and non-lethal beanbags.</li>
		<li>EMP will inflict electrical burns on anyone in the blast radius. Mechanoids take doubled damage.</li>
		<li>You can rely on enemies to drop ammunition, or you can craft it yourself at a machining table or a loading bench.</li>
		<li>Armor-piercing ammo offers superior armor penetration but less damage than FMJ. The reverse is true for Hollow-Points.</li>
		
	  <!-- Prometheum/FSX -->
		<li>Boomalope herds and blazebulb fields are just about volatile enough for crafting your own explosive ordnance.</li>
		<li>Cold climates benefit from more favourable blazebulb growth conditions. Blazebulbs can be harvested for mass explosives production.</li>
		<li>Warm climates benefit from boomalope and boomrat herds, which can be milked for mass explosives production.</li>
		<li>Boomalopes can be harvested for FSX, an explosive compound used to create explosive weapons and ammo.</li>
		<li>Prometheum can be harvested from Blazebulb plants. But beware, temperatures above 28 degrees will cause them to combust.</li>
		
	  <!-- Shields -->
		<li>Shields combine well with one-handed pistols and -melee weapons, although using these weapons puts your arms in harm's way.</li>
		<li>Ballistic shields can stop most small-arms fire and allow you to close to melee range safely.</li>
		
	  <!-- Building -->
		<li>Embrasures provide a safer, but not impenetrable, location to lay down machinegun fire on assailants. Be sure to wear a helmet when peeking over them!</li>
		<li>Cover provides a hard obstruction for your legs and torso, but your head still pokes out.</li>
		<li>Auto-turrets are portable and can be crafted in machining tables with the right research, or bought from merchants. Make sure to keep them stocked up on ammo.</li>
		
	  <!-- Environment -->
		<li>Precipitation, wind direction and speed all have a significant effect on fire spread. Beware of being downwind from a bush fire.</li>
		<li>Indoor fires will create clouds of lethal smoke. Use gas masks to protect yourself.</li>
		
	  <!-- Mechanoids -->
		<li>Mechanoids are extremely well armored mechanoids intended to shrug off small arms fire and break defensive lines. Defeating them requires special weapons and tactics.</li>
		<li>Large mechanoids' 20 mmRHA armour outperforms most armoured personnel carriers. Stock up on high penetration ammunition if you plan to take one out.</li>
		<li>Don't try to shiv the giant murderbot.</li>
		<li>Centipedes carry heavy assault weapons that can easily punch through heavy armor and cover. Their long range and accuracy make them deadly.</li>
		
	  <!-- Insect hives -->
		<li>Smoke from fires will block insectoid pheromones and pacify them, allowing easy access to their hives.</li>
