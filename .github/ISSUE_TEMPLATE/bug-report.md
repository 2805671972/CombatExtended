## Declarations of Due Diligence
(Tick the boxes that apply to you)

I declare that:
* [ ] I have tested to make sure a new savegame works with only Core and CE:FT
* [ ] I have tested to make sure this issue is not also found in the original Combat Extended mod
* [ ] I have narrowed down the affected mod(s), by testing them individually or through a binary search
* [ ] I have searched the issue tracker, and made sure this issue hasn't been reported before
* [ ] I am reporting only one issue at a time, and not combining several issues in one report
* [ ] I understand that the CE:FT team reserves the right to close my issue at any time, regardless of whether or not my problem has been resolved, if I have been found to not have performed the due diligence required
